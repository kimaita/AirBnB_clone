# AirBnB Clone

The larger AirBnB clone project has the goal of creating and deploying a simple copy of the [AirBnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/). It consists of 4 parts:

1. **Command interpreter:** to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
2. **Website:** shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic (the front-end).
3. **Storage:** a database or files (data = objects)
4. **API:** provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## The Console

The console project is a command interpreter for use in manipulating data. It enables managing the objects of the AirBnB clone project without a visual interface. Here we will be creating a storage engine that abstracts objects from their storage and persistence; offering basic CRUD functionality and a few other functions.

The specific objectives in this part of the project are:

* Creation of the data model
* CRUD functionality via a console
* JSON file persistence
